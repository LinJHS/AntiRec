  **AntiRec** is a cross-platform client application designed for real-time audio capture, processing, and playback. Built on the modern [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework, it offers a seamless experience across multiple operating systems with efficient audio handling capabilities. üöÄ

  Leveraging its powerful audio processing capabilities, AntiRec introduces a controlled perturbation into the microphone input to provide advanced privacy protection. This feature is designed to prevent automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems from recognizing the content, without affecting normal communication, thus thwarting potential eavesdropping attempts and ensuring that private communications remain confidential. With these functionalities, AntiRec aims to provide users with a secure environment for real-time audio interactions while maintaining the integrity and usability of the captured audio.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Audio Capture**: Capture audio seamlessly from any input device.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Low Resource Consumption**: Optimized for lightweight performance with Tauri.
- **Efficient Processing**: Fast, real-time audio processing pipeline.
- **Custom Playback Options**: Flexible playback configurations for different use cases.
